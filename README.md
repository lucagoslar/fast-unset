### Example

Find further examples at [/src/\_\_tests\_\_/](/src/__tests__/).

```js
import funset from 'fast-unset';

let object = {
	secret: 'shhh',
	morning: false,
	child: [
		[
			{
				morning: false,
				secret: 'shhh',
				child: {
					morning: false,
				},
			},
		],
	],
	nested: {
		pin: 1234,
		nested: {
			anothersecret: 'shh',
		},
	},
};

let mofifier = {
	secret: { deep: true, rule: null }, // Will remove all occurrences of property "secret"
	child: { morning: { deep: true, rule: null } }, // Will remove all occurrences of property "morning" starting at property "child"

	nested: {
		pin: { value: null }, // Removes property "pin" of property "nested"
		nested: { anothersecret: null }, // Will remove nested property "anothersecret"
	},

	// nested: {
	// 	rule: [
	// 		{ pin: { value: null } },
	// 		{ nested: { rule: { anothersecret: { rule: null } } } },
	// 	],
	// }, //! Also valid syntax, though not recommended due to performance impact
};
let settings = {
	clone: false, // Instead, working on a deep clone of the object
}; // Optional

funset(object, mofifier, settings);

console.log(object);

/* Outputs the following â€¦

  {
		morning: false,
		child: [
			[
				{
					child: {},
				},
			],
		],
		nested: {
			pin: null,
			nested: {},
		},
	}

```

### Usage

_Generally speaking_ - mimic the structure of the object to be mutated.
\
To remove a property, you can set its value to null. You can also set the property to an object that contains another property called `rule` valuing null.
To set a value, pass the property an object that contains a `value` property.

#### Behaviour

A property may contain flags, such as `deep` or `default`, and the available modifies `rule` and `value`.

#### Flags

##### `deep`

The `deep` flag applies the passed value of the property globally.

Example:

```js
funset(object, { prop: { deep: true, rule: null } });
```

The passed object will get searched for occurrences of the property `prop`. Findings will be removed - including nested ones. If specified, you can also set values. \
The `deep` flag may get used in combination with the `default` flag.

---

##### `default`

```js
funset(object, { prop: { default: true, value: null } });
```

The property `value` of the property `prop` will only get set if the object passed does not contain `prop`.

---

##### `direct`

```js
funset(object, { prop: { direct: true, value: null } });
```

The property `value` of `prop` will get removed. \
Note that this flag is only required if either of the properties `value` and `rule` are present in the object.

The equivalent, not using the flag `direct` would be the following.
Using the `rule` modifier will be slower and more challenging to read in a complex environment.

```js
funset(object, { prop: { rule: { value: null } } });
```

---

#### Deleting properties

```js
funset(object, { prop: { nestedprop: null } }); // Short for â€¦
funset(object, {
	prop: { rule: { nestedprop: { rule: null } } },
});
```

#### Setting values

```js
funset(object, {
	prop: { value: new Date() },
});
```

#### Known limitattions

You cannot access the properties "direct" and "value" or "rule" in combination if nested. Alternatively, you can place these in the `rule` flag.

##### Such special cases

```js
funset(
	{ value: 1, rule: 1, direct: 1 }, // Object
	{ value: null, rule: null, direct: null } // Modifier
); // No action required

funset(
	{ prop: { value: 1, rule: 1, direct: 1 } }, // Object
	{ prop: { rule: { value: null, rule: null, direct: null } } } // Modifier
); // See the flag "rule" containing another filter
```

##### Special case: array

```js
funset(
	{ value: [[{ prop: 1 }]] }, // Object
	{ value: { rule: { prop: null } } } // Modifier
);
```

As seen in this example, brackets must not be set but are helpful if you want to split up rules for better readability.
